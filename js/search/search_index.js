Angular\nThis project was generated with angular-cli.\nIt is a demo project for demonstrating Compodoc features :\n\narchitecture\ncomponents documentation\nembedding images\ndocumentating methods and properties of components, classes, interfaces, etc...\n\nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory. Use the -prod flag for a production build.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the angular-cli use ng --help or go check out the Angular-CLI README.\nCompodoc supports syntax highlighting\nExample :function hello() {\n    console.log(\"hello world !\");\n}Screenshots of the application -
